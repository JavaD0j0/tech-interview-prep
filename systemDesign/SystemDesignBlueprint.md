# System Design Blueprint

## 1. DNS (Domain Name System)

**Purpose:** DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses that machines can understand.

- **Root Nameserver (NS):** The starting point for resolving a domain, directing to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) server.
- **Top-Level Domain Nameserver (TLD NS):** Resolves domain extensions like .com, .org, etc., pointing to the authoritative nameserver.
- **Authoritative Nameserver:** The final step that resolves the domain to an IP address.
- **ISP (Internet Service Provider):** Connects the user's request to the server using the resolved IP.

**Relevance:** Ensures quick domain resolution for user requests, minimizing latency.

## 2. Load Balancing

**Purpose:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.

- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all client requests. Handles authentication, rate limiting, logging, etc.
- **Load Balancer:** Routes traffic to backend servers. Can implement strategies like round-robin, least connections, or consistent hashing.
- **Frontend Servers:** Handle user connections (e.g., serving static/dynamic content or managing real-time streaming).

**Relevance:** Prevents server overload, ensures scalability, and improves system availability.

## 3. CDN (Content Delivery Network)

**Purpose:** Speeds up content delivery by caching static files (images, videos, HTML) at edge locations closer to users.

- **Static/Stream with Adaptive Bitrate (ABR):** Delivers video streams with varying quality depending on user bandwidth.
- **Cache Hit/Miss:** Reduces latency by serving content directly from edge servers when cached.

**Relevance:** Enhances user experience by reducing load times for global users.

## 4. Services to Scale System

**Purpose:** Provides tools to handle distributed requests and manage scalability.

- **Distributed ID Generator:** Creates unique identifiers for entities (e.g., users, messages).
- **Distributed Resource Locking:** Ensures consistency by locking shared resources during updates.

**Relevance:** Necessary for managing consistency and scalability in distributed environments.

## 5. Cache

**Purpose:** Stores frequently accessed data to improve performance.

- **Write-Through and Write-Around:** Strategies for syncing cache with databases.
- **Eviction Policies:** Handles limited cache size by removing old data (e.g., LRU, LFU).
- **Distributed Cache:** Shares cache across nodes for scalability (e.g., Redis, Memcached).

**Relevance:** Reduces database load and speeds up query response times.

## 6. Database

**Purpose:** Persistent storage for structured data.

- **SQL (Relational Databases):** Used for structured queries.
- **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB):** Used for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Sharding and Replication:** Enhances database scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Cold/Hot Data:** Separates frequently accessed data (hot) from infrequently accessed data (cold) for efficiency.

**Relevance:** Supports the application's data needs while ensuring high availability and performance.

## 7. Upload Video/Image

**Purpose:** Handles media uploads and processing.

- **Queue:** Manages uploads by queuing tasks for asynchronous processing.
- **Processing Workers:** Validate, encode, and store uploaded media.
- **Object Storage:** Stores large files efficiently (e.g., AWS S3, GCS).

**Relevance:** Ensures reliability and scalability for user-generated content.

## 8. Common Fan-Out Services

**Purpose:** Manages additional services triggered by application events.

- **Notification Service:** Sends alerts (e.g., push notifications, emails).
- **Search Service:** Indexes and retrieves data efficiently.
- **Analytics Service:** Tracks user activity for reporting and optimization.
- **Payment Service:** Handles transactions securely.

**Relevance:** Adds critical functionality to enhance user experience and business operations.

## 9. Dispatcher

**Purpose:** Coordinates communication between different servers or services.

**Relevance:** Centralizes request distribution to optimize resource usage.

## Summary

This blueprint provides a modular approach to building scalable systems. Each section addresses critical aspects like:

- Handling high traffic (Load Balancing, CDN).
- Maintaining fast performance (Cache, Services).
- Ensuring data integrity and availability (Database, Distributed Services).
- Supporting core business features (Upload Services, Fan-Out Services).
